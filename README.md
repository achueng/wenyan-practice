# Breakdown of Wenyan Programming Language 文言文編程語言

Wenyan Programming Language is a programming language based on Classical Chinese (文言文 *wényánwén*).

## Benefits of Wenyan

Wenyan Programming Language can help Chinese speaking computer programmers look at Classical Chinese from a different perspective, and learn more about the ancient script that is no longer in active use today.

This programming language can also potentially help Chinese speakers learning coding for the first time with adjusting to computer language. Although each word in Classical Chinese can have multiple meanings leaving the scripts ambiguous most of the time, the reliability on context of Classical Chinese makes it one of the most crucial features similar to computer language. 

Take the keyword ***this*** for example. When I first learned about the concept of ***this***, it made me first think of how the word *this* is used in English, but it wasn't quite sufficient. Then a light bulb lit up in my head and I though of how the pronoun ***其 (qí)*** was used in Classical Chinese to refer to various things. The allowance of ambiguity of Classical Chinese made it possible for ***其 (qí)*** to refer different words and phrases based on position and context, much like how ***this*** in computer language (JavaScript in specificity) can refer different objects depending on the position and context of it in the script.

Drawing from my light bulb moment when learning about ***this***, learning about the Wenyan programming language helped me get a better understanding of both Classical Chinese and computer languages. 

## Drawbacks of Wenyan

This programming language is only understandable by a select group of people. Wenyan is written in Classical Chinese, and the language itself is a written script understood only by those who choose to study it. Although all Chinese students study Classical Chinese in school, only some grasp a true understanding of the ancient language.
